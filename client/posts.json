Contrary to popular opinion, in summer locals enjoy plentiful hot weather, and take full advantage of the coastline in the south of the country among other delights. Here’s our pick of the best things to see and do when the sun’s shining in Ukraine. Capture the sunrise and sunset on the Sea of Azov Ukraine can proudly boast two different seas. One of them is the Sea of Azov, which is the shallowest in the world – its depth doesn’t reach beyond 13.5 meters (44 feet). The resorts on this stretch of coast are popular for family holidays, especially those with toddlers. Among the most popular towns and cities are Berdiansk and Kyrylivka, home not only to great opportunities for lazy sunbathing days, but also the best wellness spots in Ukraine. As it is still quite warm in the evenings, staying on the beach from the early morning till evening makes for capturing some incredibly beautiful sunrises and sunsets.",

		"bodyPost": "Visiting France in AutumnDiscovering France in Autumn is arguably the best season to do so. The vast car parks of major tourist sites such as Mont-Saint-Michel, Rocamadour, Sarlat, Lake Annecy and Les Baux-de-Provence look almost empty, especially on week days. September and October are the best touristic periods to discover France when the crowds of visitors have long gone and the places are left to locals and lucky visitors.Autumn in France: Foliage and WeatherThe days of September can often be quite warm and it is not unusual to enjoy an “Indian summer” with the characteristic coloured Autumn foliage: yellow, orange and red. This term, borrowed from the spectacularly colourful display of foliage in New England, is also known in Europe as the St. Martin Summer whose celebration day occurs on 11 November. Autumnal colours are typically at their peak in France in early to mid November. Saint-Michel Chapel, Le Châtelard, Savoie  Moments Some of France’s most charming places become even more attractive with Autumn colours. Rediscovering the villages and castles of France is often breathtaking, particularly under a deep blue sky. Even the French capital, Paris, is enhanced by colourful tints in Autumn, thanks to the many trees found bordering its wide avenues or planted in one of its beautiful public gardens. We recommend visiting Parc Monceau, Jardin du Luxembourg or Parc de Saint-Cloud. Parc Meissonier in Poissy near Paris Moments The weather will be slightly warmer in the south (Provence, Languedoc and Corsica) and cooler in the north (Paris Basin and Alsace). The mountainous regions of France (Alps, Pyrenees, Massif Central and Jura) can experience snow and frost as early as September and October. Overall, mild temperatures can make a walk in the mountains or a cycle tour in the forest a very enjoyable activity.",

To start: you're   going to Missouri, not Kansas. Watch when you book those flights. Check into   one of the hot new hotels in town – try 21c Museum Hotel, 'where photography   and oil painting exhibitions are as important as the lobby bar,' says   CNTraveler's Erin Florio – or Crossroads Hotel, opening this October inside a   former PBR brewery. Once you're settled, make some time for the   season-specific draws. It’s officially American football season, and Kansas   Chiefs fans are both diehard and non-obnoxious. Catch a game at Arrowhead   Stadium, or if you prefer your touchdowns with a side of nachos, at bars such   as Westport Ale House and Tanner’s Bar & Grill. As for typical autumn   activities, you can’t do much better than Louisburg Cider Mill’s 40th Annual   Ciderfest, held from late September to early October. You’ll find live   bluegrass music, a 10-acre corn maze, pony rides, and, of course, a lot of   food. You’d be a sucker not to try the apple-cider doughnuts. More of an   indoors person? You’ll be happy to know that Kansas City Symphony’s 2018-19   season kicks off in mid-September. The 2018 headliners include Leslie Odom Jr.   with the symphony on September 22, and a full orchestra backing Ben Folds a   few days later. If you can’t make it to Kansas City in October, at least try   for Thanksgiving. The Plaza Lights ceremony is one for the bucket lists. By   Caitlin Morton  JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING    Go because… you won't have to share this outdoor playground with the crowds   Jackson Hole, in a valley ringed by the Grand Tetons, is ground zero for   adrenaline tourism. Until mid-October when the frost sets in, you’ll have cool   nights and warm days perfect for hiking and biking the acres of trails within   the Bridger-Teton National Forest, where the foliage will be ablaze. (Though   hopefully not literally – check the latest on wildfires in the area.) You can   still raft the Snake River, though you’ll want to wear a wetsuit on the   whitewater segments, and fly-fishing is amazing right now. For the best valley   views, take the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort Tram to the top and hike down,   then refuel at Bar Enoteca, with its locally made charcuterie and superb wine   list. Book a room right there at Four Seasons Resort and Residences Teton   Village (hooray for off-season rates), just a mile south of the gate to Grand   Teton National Park. The early morning wildlife viewing is unbeatable this   time of year (expect moose and bison), and before dusk you’ll hear the elk   bugling while they mate and migrate. Or stay in the town of Jackson at the   boutique Hotel Jackson and spend an afternoon shopping the square for haute   Western-themed leather accessories at Man Toy Shop or blankets at Pendleton,   getting your buzz on at Local bar before an Asian-flavoured Italian dinner at   Glorietta (the kitchen is helmed by a Momofuku alum). No matter where you   stay, a night at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, with its giant taxidermy and   honky-tonk dance floor, is a must. By Alex Postman ",

		"bodyPost": "There are no crowds    It is a fact universally acknowledged that in Japan, there are crowds. Lots of   them. It’s part of the charm of the experience: Tokyo’s Shibuya scramble   crossing wouldn’t be quite the same without the swarms of pedestrians, and   would the cherry blossom be as enjoyable without the festive atmosphere and   parties gathered beneath the trees?     But if you are allergic to queues and the thought of a squashed subway   carriage sends you running for the hills, consider travelling in the winter.   Throughout the colder months you will find many of the country’s most iconic   sights almost completely deserted – and none the worse for being wreathed in   snow or touched with a hint of frost.  Snowsports    Japan is over 70% mountainous, boasts over 500 ski resorts and receives some   of the world’s most reliable snowfall thanks to icy winds blowing in across   the sea from Siberia. All this considered, it’s pretty much the most epic   snowsports location in the universe.     Japan’s ski resorts go from the absolutely minuscule to the world-class, with   incredibly long, sweeping runs and superb powder snow. Having hosted the   Winter Olympics in 1972 and 1998 and the Asian Winter games numerous times –   and Japan being Japan – ski resort infrastructure and hospitality is generally   top-notch – with après-ski to rival anywhere in the world.
